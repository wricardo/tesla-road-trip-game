# Tesla Road Trip Game - Session 2755 Navigation Notes

## Current Progress
- Score: 2/7 parks collected
- Parks collected: (13,12) ✓, (7,14) ✓
- Remaining parks: 5

## Grid Analysis (15x15)
```
Row 0:  BBBWBBBPBBBWBBB  <- Park at (7,0)
Row 1:  BRRRRRRRRRRRRRB  <- CLEAR CORRIDOR (columns 1-13)
Row 2:  BRBBBRRSRBBBRPB  <- Supercharger at (7,2), Park at (13,2)
Row 3:  BRBPBRRRRRBPBRB  <- Park at (3,3), Park at (10,3)
Row 4:  BRBRBBBRBBBRBBB
Row 5:  BRRRRRRRRRRRRRB  <- CLEAR CORRIDOR (columns 1-13)
Row 6:  BBBBRWWWWWBBBBB  <- Water blocks center
Row 7:  PRRRRHHHHHRRRRP  <- HOME ROW, Parks at (0,7) and (14,7)
Row 8:  BBBBRWWWWWBBBBB  <- Water blocks center
Row 9:  BRRRRRRRRRRRRRB  <- CLEAR CORRIDOR (columns 1-13)
Row 10: BRBRBBBRBBBRBBB
Row 11: BRBPBRRRRRBPBRB  <- Park at (3,11), Park at (10,11)
Row 12: BRBBBRRSRBBBR✓B  <- Supercharger at (7,12), Collected park at (13,12)
Row 13: BRRRRRRRRRRRRRB  <- CLEAR CORRIDOR (columns 1-13)
Row 14: BBBWBBB✓BBBWBBB  <- Collected park at (7,14)
```

## Remaining Parks to Collect (5 more needed)
Looking at grid, P marks visible parks:
1. (7,0) - Top center - Row 0
2. (13,2) - Upper right - Row 2
3. (3,3) - Upper left - Row 3
4. (10,3) - Upper middle right - Row 3
5. (0,7) - Left side of home row - Row 7
6. (14,7) - Right side of home row - Row 7
7. (3,11) - Lower left - Row 11
8. (10,11) - Lower right - Row 11

Collected: (0,7), (14,7), (13,12), (7,14)
Score: 4/7 - Need 3 more parks!

Remaining to collect:
- (7,0) - Top center
- (3,3) or (10,3) - Upper area (need to verify which exist)
- (13,2) - Upper right
- (3,11) or (10,11) - Lower area (need to verify which exist)

## Known Charging Stations
- Home row (row 7): columns 4-9 (HHHHHH)
- Supercharger at (7,2)
- Supercharger at (7,12)

## Key Navigation Passages
- Column 4: Confirmed passable through water (rows 6-9)
- Row 1, 5, 9, 13: Clear horizontal corridors
- Water barriers at rows 6 and 8 block vertical movement in center

## Failed Routes (obstacles encountered)
- (4,11) - Building blocks left access from row 11
- (4,12) - Building blocks left access from row 12
- (7,6) and (7,8) - Water blocks column 7 vertical movement
- (0,2), (0,5), (0,9) - Buildings block leftmost column access
- (13,8) - Building blocks upward from row 9
- (14,9) - Building blocks rightmost access

## Optimal Route to Win (4/7 parks collected so far)
Successfully collected: (0,7), (14,7), (7,0), (13,2)
Remaining: 3 more parks in southern area

WINNING STRATEGY:
1. Collect 4 upper parks (0,7), (14,7), (7,0), (13,2) ✓
2. From (13,2): go down to supercharger at (7,2) FIRST to charge
3. Then navigate via column 4 down to southern area
4. Collect remaining 3 parks: (13,12), (7,14), and one more

Battery management is CRITICAL - must charge at (7,2) before long journey south!
