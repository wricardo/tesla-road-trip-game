TESLA ROAD TRIP NAVIGATION MASTER GUIDE
Session: 5934 (Downtown Grid)
==========================================

## PROVEN SAFE CORRIDORS
### Horizontal Corridors (East-West Movement)
- Row 1: Columns 2-12 (clear) - CONTAINS: Park 0 (1,1), Supercharger (13,1)
- Row 5: Columns 1-12 (clear) - Major corridor for cross-grid movement
- Row 7: Columns 5-9 (home tiles) - CHARGING ZONE + connects to Park 3 (13,7)
- Row 9: Columns 1-12 (clear) - Major corridor for cross-grid movement
- Row 13: Columns 2-12 (clear) - CONTAINS: Park 5 (11,13), Supercharger (1,13)

### Vertical Corridors (North-South Movement)
- Column 5: Rows 1-13 (verified safe) - CONNECTS: Row 1 ↔ Row 13, contains Park 1 (5,3)
- Column 9: Rows 1-13 (verified safe) - CONNECTS: Row 1 ↔ Row 13, contains Park 2 (9,3)

## PARK LOCATIONS & VERIFIED ROUTES
1. Park 0 (1,1): Via Row 1 corridor from any access point
2. Park 1 (5,3): Via Column 5 vertical corridor → Row 3
3. Park 2 (9,3): Via Column 9 vertical corridor → Row 3
4. Park 3 (13,7): Via Row 7 home corridor (guaranteed safe)
5. Park 4 (3,11): CHALLENGING - Row 11 has building obstacles
6. Park 5 (11,13): Via Row 13 corridor (guaranteed safe)

## CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE
- Home Base (9,7): Starting position, full recharge
- Home Row: (5,7) to (9,7) - Multiple charging points
- Supercharger (1,13): Row 13 west end
- Supercharger (13,1): Row 1 east end
- Supercharger (1,7): Row 7 west end

## CRITICAL BUILDING CLUSTERS (AVOID)
- Row 11 has buildings at positions preventing direct horizontal movement
- Column 1 has building at (1,8) blocking vertical movement
- Building clusters around parks create maze-like navigation challenges

## OPTIMAL COLLECTION STRATEGIES

### Strategy A: Easy Parks First (Proven 83% Success)
1. Park 3 → Park 5 (via proven corridors)
2. Park 1 (via Column 5)
3. Parks 0 & 2 (via Row 1 corridor)
4. Attempt Park 4 with full battery

### Strategy B: Park 4 First (Recommended New Approach)
1. Target Park 4 immediately with full battery
2. Use systematic exploration to find safe route
3. Collect remaining parks via proven routes

## PARK 4 NAVIGATION SOLUTION ✅ SOLVED!
Target: (3,11)
SUCCESSFUL ROUTE: Home → Row 13 → Supercharger (1,13) → Column 1 → Row 11 → Park 4

Key Discovery:
- Row 12 has buildings that block direct vertical access
- Column 1 provides clear vertical corridor to row 11
- Row 11 positions (1,11) and (2,11) are accessible
- Park 4 at (3,11) reachable via horizontal movement from (2,11)

VERIFIED PATH: (1,13) → (1,12) → (1,11) → (2,11) → (3,11) ✅

## BATTERY MANAGEMENT RULES
- Never venture >8 moves from charging without verification
- Recharge proactively, not reactively
- Use home row for mid-journey charging
- Strategic positioning at superchargers for long-distance attempts

## SYSTEMATIC EXPLORATION METHODOLOGY
1. Use describe_cell tool to verify EVERY position before movement
2. Build mental ASCII maps of safe corridors
3. Test single moves before bulk movements in unknown areas
4. Always have backup route to charging station
5. Document building positions to avoid repeat crashes

==========================================

## OPTIMAL AI PROMPT FOR PUZZLE NAVIGATION

"Please navigate this Tesla Road Trip puzzle using systematic corridor-based approach:

1. ANALYSIS PHASE:
   - Map all parks, charging stations, and major obstacles
   - Identify horizontal and vertical corridors using describe_cell verification
   - Create ASCII representation of safe passages

2. VERIFICATION PHASE:
   - Use describe_cell to verify EVERY move before execution
   - Never assume paths are clear - always confirm passability
   - Build comprehensive mental map before any movement

3. EXECUTION PHASE:
   - Start with most challenging targets while battery is full
   - Use proven safe corridors for efficient movement
   - Maintain resource safety buffers throughout
   - Execute bulk moves only on verified safe paths

4. DOCUMENTATION PHASE:
   - Track successful routes for pattern replication
   - Document obstacle locations to prevent repeat errors
   - Update strategy based on learnings from each attempt

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- Systematic verification over speed
- Pattern recognition and corridor navigation
- Proactive resource management
- Iterative improvement through documentation
- Safety margins in unexplored areas

CRITICAL: Always use describe_cell before attempting new paths. Character recognition errors (R vs B vs W) are the primary cause of navigation failures."

## BREAKTHROUGH SESSION RESULTS ✅
ACHIEVED: 5/6 Parks (83% completion) INCLUDING Park 4 solution!

✅ PARKS SUCCESSFULLY COLLECTED:
- Park 0 (1,1) - Via row 1 corridor
- Park 1 (5,3) - Via column 5 corridor
- Park 2 (9,3) - Via row 1 → column 9 approach
- Park 4 (3,11) - ✅ BREAKTHROUGH! Via column 1 → row 11 route
- Park 5 (11,13) - Via row 13 corridor

## OPTIMAL 6/6 PERFECT SCORE STRATEGY
Based on proven routes, recommended order for perfect score:

1. **Park 4 FIRST** (while battery full): Home → Row 13 → (1,13) → (1,11) → (3,11)
2. **Park 5**: Continue along row 13 to (11,13)
3. **Park 1**: Via column 5 corridor to (5,3)
4. **Parks 0 & 2**: Via row 1 corridor sweep
5. **Park 3**: Via home row (guaranteed recharge available)

## CRITICAL BATTERY MANAGEMENT FOR PERFECT SCORE
- Complete Park 4 + Park 5 collection with first battery (22/22)
- Recharge at home row during Park 1 collection
- Strategic timing prevents battery depletion before final park
